### Contributing to timeline-miner

Like my other repositories, I try to make my projects welcoming to new comers. Whether you are new to open source or to programming in general, this is a nice starter project.
Check [how to contribute page](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

Please see open issues, fork and pull request after manually testing some CSV files:

One good example for input:

Any Wikipedia summary (Introduction section) that has some historical dates. for example:

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.
- Or anything else.

#### Test

There is obviously no automated testing now, It would be nice to create one for extreme values.

#### Collaboration and todos

- Automated tests
- Decouple code for readibility
- Revise split mechanism
- Better UI (probably with themes) and better code export

(See open issues)
(Please for any deployment, keep it fair and mention this repository)

#### Deployment

Python run django project.

It is deployed with no automation for tests here timeline-miner.herokuapp.com (limited resources).
